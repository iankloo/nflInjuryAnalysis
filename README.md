# NFL Injury Analysis

This project is part of a larger project to create an app that helps manage fantasy football teams.  

The injury analysis module will be a key piece in the optomization procedure that generates the best team in a given week.  The idea is to quantify uncertainty related to injuries.  I plan to use Bayesian modeling to find probabilities associated with different injury circumstances - ultimately using these to generate expected points.  

If there are good results, this might make an interesting infographic/write up on its own.
